# Shedding Bad Habits

Shedding bad habits is not the same as developing good ones, but can lead to their development.

1) Habits are a product of your environment

Realize that a bad habit is not some fundamental property of yourself; it is the environment you have placed yourself in, repeatedly, that continually influences your actions.

2) Will power will work short term, but probably not long term

You may shed a bad habit through will power alone. However, this may prove hard to sustain long term as will power appears limited and is susceptible to your mood and emotions.

3) To shed a bad habit, change your environment, or reduce friction to desired actions

* You cannot eat junk food you do not buy
* You cannot watch TV on a TV you do not own
* You will be dirty if your house or room is dirty
* You will be anti-social if you do not place yourself in social situations
* If you pack your bag for the gym the night before, you are more likely to go to the gym in the morning
